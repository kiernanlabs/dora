([bengals.com](https://www.bengals.com/team/coaches-roster/zac-taylor?utm_source=openai)) Given typical timing (many firings occur in the week after the regular season) and multiple other vulnerable coaches league‑wide, I assess Cincinnati as a plausible but not the single most likely next coach‑out, so ~20% reflects that mix of pressure and organizational tolerance.",yes

([baltimoreravens.com](https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/john-harbaugh-contract-extension-ravens-three-years-2028?utm_source=openai)) The Ravens are 7-8 and facing possible elimination with recent media reports of friction around Lamar Jackson increasing short‑term scrutiny, which raises the risk slightly—but given Harbaugh’s long tenure and owner support, Baltimore remains considerably less likely than many struggling teams to be the next coach out before Feb 8, 2026.
