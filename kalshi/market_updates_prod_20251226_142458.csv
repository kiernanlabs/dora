By contrast, multiple other NFL coaches are publicly discussed as being on much hotter seats this season, making it far more likely the next coaching exit will come from a struggling team rather than Tampa Bay.

Most coaching exits in this window come from clearly underperforming teams and several coaches have already been dismissed or are widely viewed as on the hot seat this season, so other franchises are far more likely to produce the next departure.

([statmuse.com](https://www.statmuse.com/nfl/team/pittsburgh-steelers-50/2025?utm_source=openai)) Several other coaches have already been dismissed this season (e.g., Brian Daboll, Brian Callahan) and there are clearer ‘hot seat’ candidates around the league, so the next departure is much more likely to come from a higher‑risk situation than Pittsburgh unless an unexpected scandal or health issue occurs.

([commanders.com](https://www.commanders.com/team/standings/?utm_source=openai))  However, other struggling teams (the Giants already fired their coach midseason) and Quinn’s strong run in 2024 give him some leash, so I estimate about a 30% chance Washington is the next NFL head coach to leave before Feb 8, 2026.
