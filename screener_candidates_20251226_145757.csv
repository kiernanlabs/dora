KXCPI-25DEC-T0.2,KXCPI-25DEC,Will CPI rise more than 0.2% in December 2025?,11658,28139,16995,38,45,57.0,"Headline monthly CPI in late-2025 is likely to hover near the ~0.15–0.25% range, so December is near the threshold; however, large, sticky shelter and services components (which tend to add steady upward pressure) and the possibility of an energy uptick make a slightly better-than-even chance that the month exceeds 0.2%. Offsetting forces include typical holiday discounts in goods and the overall cooler inflation trend, so I assign a modest tilt above 50%.",15,5,5,5,0.04,yes
KXSP500ADDQ-26MAR31-SOFI,KXSP500ADDQ-26MAR31,"Will SoFi be added to S&P 500 before Mar 31, 2026?",2298,1879,1407,54,60,25.0,"I assign a 25% chance because inclusion in the S&P 500 requires sustained market-cap scale, sufficient public float and recent GAAP profitability, and the committee typically waits for clear, sustained qualification before adding a company. As of late 2025 SoFi’s market cap and earnings profile remain borderline and the three-month window (Jan–Mar 2026) is short, so while inclusion is possible if its metrics improve quickly, it is more likely to be delayed.",8,5,5,5,0.04,yes
KXRECOGSOMALI-29,KXRECOGSOMALI-29,Will Trump recognize Somaliland?,1787,3267,3016,53,62,20.0,"U.S. recognition of Somaliland would be a major departure from long-standing U.S. and African Union positions and would provoke strong Somali and regional resistance, so baseline likelihood is low. However, Trump has shown a willingness to take unilateral, high-profile recognition steps for geopolitical signaling (e.g., Jerusalem/Golan), and Somaliland’s strategic location and bilateral ties give a non-negligible chance he might do the same, so I assign a modest ~20% probability.

KXWCCREG-26-GONZ,KXWCCREG-26,Will Gonzaga be the West Coast Conference regular season champions?,1453,8728,2367,46,76,65.0,"Gonzaga has been the dominant program in the WCC for decades with stable elite coaching, recruiting, and a track record of regularly winning the conference regular season, so they enter most seasons as the clear favorite. However, Saint Mary’s and other WCC teams have periodically closed the gap and single-season roster turnover/transfer risk introduces meaningful variability, so while likely, it is not a near-certainty.",12,5,5,5,0.04,yes
KXSWIFTKELCEWEDDINGLOCATION-30-RHO,KXSWIFTKELCEWEDDINGLOCATION-30,Where will Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s Wedding occur?,1281,2132,3851,58,86,8.0,"Neither Swift nor Kelce have strong, publicly known ties to Rhode Island compared with places like New York, Nashville, Kansas City, or private estates they already own, so it is an uncommon but possible choice. Rhode Island’s exclusive coastal venues make a wedding there plausible, but given typical celebrity preferences for privacy, family locations, or properties they already use, it remains unlikely before 2030.",10,5,5,5,0.04,yes
KXLEADERNFLPYDS-26JAN05-MSTA,KXLEADERNFLPYDS-26JAN05,Will Matthew Stafford lead American Pro Football League in Most Passing Yards for the 2025-2026 Regular Season?,1171,3213,1058,26,37,8.0,"Stafford is an older veteran who typically plays in a scheme that does not push ultra-high passing volume, and leading the league generally requires both very high attempts and a full, healthy season. Younger, high-volume quarterbacks (e.g., Mahomes, Allen, Herbert, Burrow and others) are more likely to produce the raw yardage totals required, and Stafford’s age and injury risk make this outcome unlikely.",12,5,5,5,0.04,yes
KXTECHLAYOFF-25NOV-1.4,KXTECHLAYOFF-25NOV,Tech layoffs up in Nov 2025?,815,1685,572,42,49,22.0,"Historically the information sector’s monthly layoff rate is volatile but typically stays below 1.4% except during concentrated industry downturns (e.g., the 2022–23 wave). By late 2025 I assess a modest chance of renewed tech-specific restructuring or macro weakness pushing the rate above 1.4%, but absent a clear recession or major industry shock it remains unlikely, so I estimate about a one-in-five chance.",3,5,5,5,0.04,yes
EVSHARE-30JAN-30,EVSHARE-30JAN,EV market share in 2030?,733,916,718,48,54,75.0,"Global EV new-car shares have been rising quickly and by 2030 cost parity, widespread OEM electrification plans, and strong policy and charging buildouts make it likely the monthly share will exceed 30%. Remaining risks—resource/supply constraints, slower uptake in some emerging markets, and infrastructure gaps—prevent near‑certainty, so I assess around a three‑in‑four chance.",7,5,5,5,0.04,yes
KXCABLEAVE-25-26MAR,KXCABLEAVE-25,Will any member of Trump's Cabinet leave before Feb 2026?,685,1016,986,37,44,85.0,"Historically, administrations almost always experience at least one Cabinet departure within a year, and Trump’s combative style and high political pressure make resignations or firings and announced departures more likely. Given the normal churn, policy fights, and potential scandals or personal exits during a 12‑month span, it is highly probable at least one Cabinet member will leave between Feb 28, 2025 and Feb 28, 2026.",15,5,5,5,0.04,yes

While SOL is volatile enough to make such a move possible, competitive pressures, past network reliability issues, and regulatory uncertainty make a large sustained rally more unlikely than likely over this horizon, so I assess a modest ~18% chance.",20,5,5,5,0.04,yes
