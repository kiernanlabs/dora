Elon Musk can produce sudden headlines, but such events in a one-week window are uncommon and would more likely move sentiment for individual races than change the market’s estimate of achieving five+ wins, so I assess a low (~15%) chance of a >20% price move in the next 7 days.",,30,"Musk has the funding and organizational reach to back multiple Congressional challengers (via America PAC and large 2024 donations), but his slate-level track record is mixed and some recent, high-profile picks have lost.
